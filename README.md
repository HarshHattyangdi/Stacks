#STACKS:

##Stacks ADT:
A linear data structure that can be thought of as a physical stack or a pile. 
Works in LIFO order where things inserted at top are removed from the top itself first, i.e 
insertion and deletion occurs from one end(top).

##Operations on a stack:
1. push : Insert elements from the top.
2. pop : Remove elements from the top.
3. top : Returns element at the top.
4. is_empty : Returns true if the stack is empty(no elements present in the stack).
4. is_full : Returns true if stack is full.
5. get_size : Returns the size of the stack.
